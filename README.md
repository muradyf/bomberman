# Bomberman
A classic Bomberman game from NES and SNES consoles written in C++ (Console-Based) using only basic concepts, having various dynamically-generated levels, and a scoreboard system. This was my first ever programming project that I received when I was in my first semester for the course 'Introduction to Computing'. (Fun fact: I was the only student in the entire batch to take up the bomberman game as a project for my first semester). It was initially built using MinGW but this project is compiled on Visual Studio.
